# DEC-0004 — Add Context Curation Engine for Context Management

**Decision Date:** 2025-12-01
**Participants:** Governance Board

## Problem Statement

AI agents working on complex projects struggle with context limits and relevance filtering. They often see either too much irrelevant information or miss critical context needed for their current task. This leads to:

- Suboptimal decisions due to missing context
- Wasted token usage on irrelevant information
- Inconsistent application of project conventions
- Difficulty maintaining awareness of changes that affect current work

The methodology needed a framework for continuously curating context so agents see only what's relevant to their current task, with automatic updates when changes occur.

## Candidate Thoughts

1. **Manual Context Management** — Require humans to specify context for each agent task manually.

2. **Full Context Inclusion** — Include all project documentation and context in every agent session.

3. **Context Curation Engine** — Create a framework that continuously evaluates, removes, and loads context based on task relevance, with automatic propagation of changes.

## Evaluation

- **Option 1 (Manual):** Places high burden on human operators. Context selection is error-prone and time-consuming. Does not scale with project complexity or agent usage frequency.

- **Option 2 (Full Inclusion):** Quickly exceeds context limits on any non-trivial project. Agents waste processing on irrelevant information. No mechanism to highlight what actually matters for the current task.

- **Option 3 (Context Curation Engine):** Balances automation with governance. Per-task Context Indexes ensure explicit scoping. Living Documentation provides governed source of truth. Automatic propagation keeps context current without manual intervention.

## Outcome

**Selected:** Option 3 — Context Curation Engine

**Implementation:**

1. **New Methodology Document** — Created `operations/METHOD-0006-context-curation-engine.md` defining:
   - Context Index structure and lifecycle
   - Turn-based context curation process
   - Automatic context update triggers
   - Living Documentation integration
   - Trust-level context access

2. **New Templates** — Added `templates/context/`:
   - `CTX-INDEX-template.md` — Task-specific context index
   - `LIVING-DOCS-template.md` — Project living documentation

3. **Integration Points:**
   - Links to Agent Trust Framework (METHOD-0004)
   - Links to Phase Checklists (METHOD-0002)
   - Governance and audit trail requirements

**Rejection Rationale:**

- Option 1 rejected because it does not scale and places excessive burden on operators.
- Option 2 rejected because it does not address context limits or relevance filtering.

## Cross-Links

- `METHOD-0006` — Context Curation Engine
- `METHOD-0004` — AI Agent Handbook (trust integration)
- `METHOD-0001` — Core method (living documentation)
- `templates/context/CTX-INDEX-template.md`
- `templates/context/LIVING-DOCS-template.md`

## Follow-Up Actions

1. Update core methodology documents to reference METHOD-0006
2. Update README.md to include new templates
3. Update templates/README.md with context template documentation
4. Add change log entry for this methodology addition
5. Validate integration with existing agent workflows

## Status Update — 2025-12-01

Implementation complete. Context Curation Engine added as METHOD-0006 with supporting templates. Cross-references and change log updated.
